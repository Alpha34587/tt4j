TreeTagger for Java is a Java wrapper around the popular link:http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/[TreeTagger] package by Helmut Schmid. It was written with a focus on platform-independence and easy integration into applications. It is written in Java 5 and has been tested on OS X, Ubuntu Linux, and Windows.

=== Code example

[source,java]
----
package org.annolab.tt4j;

import static java.util.Arrays.asList;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Point TT4J to the TreeTagger installation directory. The executable is expected
    // in the "bin" subdirectory - in this example at "/opt/treetagger/bin/tree-tagger"
    System.setProperty("treetagger.home", "/opt/treetagger");
    TreeTaggerWrapper tt = new TreeTaggerWrapper<String>();
    try {
      tt.setModel("/opt/treetagger/models/english.par:iso8859-1");
      tt.setHandler(new TokenHandler<String>() {
        public void token(String token, String pos, String lemma) {
          System.out.println(token + "\t" + pos + "\t" + lemma);
        }
      });
      tt.process(asList(new String[] { "This", "is", "a", "test", "." }));
    }
    finally {
      tt.destroy();
    }
  }
}
